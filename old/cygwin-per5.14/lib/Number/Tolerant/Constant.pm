#pod I wrote this module to make it simpler to use tolerances with Class::DBI, which

=head1 NAME

Number::Tolerant::Constant - a blessed constant type

=head1 VERSION

version 1.706

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Number::Tolerant;
 use Number::Tolerant::Constant;

 my $range  = tolerance(10);
 ref $range; # "Number::Tolerant" -- w/o ::Constant, would be undef

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When Number::Tolerant is about to return a tolerance with zero variation, it
will return a constant instead.  This module will register a constant type that
will catch these constants and return them as Number::Tolerant objects.

I wrote this module to make it simpler to use tolerances with Class::DBI, which
would otherwise complain that the constructor hadn't returned a blessed object.

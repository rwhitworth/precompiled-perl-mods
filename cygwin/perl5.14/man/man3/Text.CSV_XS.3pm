Text::CSV_XS  provides facilities for the composition  and decomposition of
comma-separated values.  An instance of the Text::CSV_XS class will combine
fields into a \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR string and parse a \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR string into fields.
.PP
The module accepts either strings or files as input  and support the use of
user-specified characters for delimiters, separators, and escapes.
.SS "Embedded newlines"
.IX Subsection "Embedded newlines"
\&\fBImportant Note\fR:  The default behavior is to accept only \s-1ASCII\s0 characters
in the range from \f(CW0x20\fR (space) to \f(CW0x7E\fR (tilde).   This means that the
fields can not contain newlines. If your data contains newlines embedded in
fields, or characters above \f(CW0x7E\fR (tilde), or binary data, you \fB\f(BImust\fB\fR
set \f(CW\*(C`binary => 1\*(C'\fR in the call to \*(L"new\*(R". To cover the widest range of
parsing options, you will always want to set binary.
.PP
But you still have the problem  that you have to pass a correct line to the
\&\*(L"parse\*(R" method, which is more complicated from the usual point of usage:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& my $csv = Text::CSV_XS\->new ({ binary => 1, eol => $/ });
\& while (<>) {           #  WRONG!
\&     $csv\->parse ($_);
\&     my @fields = $csv\->fields ();
\&     }
.Ve
.PP
this will break, as the \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR might read broken lines:  it does not care
about the quoting. If you need to support embedded newlines,  the way to go
is to  \fBnot\fR  pass \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR in the parser  (it accepts \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR,
\&\fBand\fR \f(CW\*(C`\er\en\*(C'\fR by default) and then
.PP

.SS "Unicode"

Unicode is only tested to work with perl\-5.8.2 and up.
.PP
On parsing (both for  \*(L"getline\*(R" and  \*(L"parse\*(R"),  if the source is marked
being \s-1UTF8\s0, then all fields that are marked binary will also be marked \s-1UTF8\s0.
.PP
For complete control over encoding, please use Text::CSV::Encoded:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& use Text::CSV::Encoded;
\& my $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({
\&     encoding_in  => "iso\-8859\-1", # the encoding comes into   Perl
\&     encoding_out => "cp1252",     # the encoding comes out of Perl
\&     });
\&
\& $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({ encoding  => "utf8" });
\& # combine () and print () accept *literally* utf8 encoded data
\& # parse () and getline () return *literally* utf8 encoded data
\&
\& $csv = Text::CSV::Encoded\->new ({ encoding  => undef }); # default
\& # combine () and print () accept UTF8 marked data
\& # parse () and getline () return UTF8 marked data
.Ve
.PP
On combining (\*(L"print\*(R"  and  \*(L"combine\*(R"):  if any of the combining fields
was marked \s-1UTF8\s0, the resulting string will be marked as \s-1UTF8\s0.  Note however
that all fields  \fIbefore\fR  the first field marked \s-1UTF8\s0 and contained 8\-bit
characters that were not upgraded to \s-1UTF8\s0,  these will be  \f(CW\*(C`bytes\*(C'\fR  in the
resulting string too, possibly causing unexpected errors.  If you pass data
of different encoding,  or you don't know if there is  different  encoding,
force it to be upgraded before you pass them on:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $csv\->print ($fh, [ map { utf8::upgrade (my $x = $_); $x } @data ]);

.SH "SPECIFICATION"

While no formal specification for \s-1CSV\s0 exists,  \s-1RFC\s0 4180 \fI1\fR) describes the

the \s-1IANA\s0. \s-1RFC\s0 7111 \fI2\fR adds fragments to \s-1CSV\s0.

Many informal documents exist that describe the \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR format. \*(L"How To: The
Comma Separated Value (\s-1CSV\s0) File Format\*(R" \fI3\fR)  provides an overview of the

best be used and supported.

.PP
The basic rules are as follows:
.PP
\&\fB\s-1CSV\s0\fR  is a delimited data format that has fields/columns separated by the
comma character and records/rows separated by newlines. Fields that contain
a special character (comma, newline, or double quote),  must be enclosed in
double quotes. However, if a line contains a single entry that is the empty
string, it may be enclosed in double quotes.  If a field's value contains a
double quote character it is escaped by placing another double quote
character next to it. The \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR file format does not require a specific
character encoding, byte order, or line terminator format.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Each record is a single line ended by a line feed  (\s-1ASCII/\s0\f(CW\*(C`LF\*(C'\fR=\f(CW0x0A\fR) or
a carriage return and line feed pair (\s-1ASCII/\s0\f(CW\*(C`CRLF\*(C'\fR=\f(CW\*(C`0x0D 0x0A\*(C'\fR), however,
line-breaks may be embedded.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fields are separated by commas.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Allowable characters within a \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR field include \f(CW0x09\fR (\f(CW\*(C`TAB\*(C'\fR) and the
inclusive range of \f(CW0x20\fR (space) through \f(CW0x7E\fR (tilde).  In binary mode
all characters are accepted, at least in quoted fields.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A field within  \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR  must be surrounded by  double-quotes to  contain  a
separator character (comma).
.PP
Though this is the most clear and restrictive definition,  Text::CSV_XS  is
way more liberal than this, and allows extension:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Line termination by a single carriage return is accepted by default
.IP "\(bu" 2
The separation\-, escape\-, and escape\- characters can be any \s-1ASCII\s0 character
in the range from  \f(CW0x20\fR (space) to  \f(CW0x7E\fR (tilde).  Characters outside
this range may or may not work as expected.  Multibyte characters, like \s-1UTF\s0
\&\f(CW\*(C`U+060C\*(C'\fR (\s-1ARABIC\s0 \s-1COMMA\s0),   \f(CW\*(C`U+FF0C\*(C'\fR (\s-1FULLWIDTH\s0 \s-1COMMA\s0),  \f(CW\*(C`U+241B\*(C'\fR (\s-1SYMBOL\s0
\&\s-1FOR\s0 \s-1ESCAPE\s0), \f(CW\*(C`U+2424\*(C'\fR (\s-1SYMBOL\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1NEWLINE\s0), \f(CW\*(C`U+FF02\*(C'\fR (\s-1FULLWIDTH\s0 \s-1QUOTATION\s0
\&\s-1MARK\s0), and \f(CW\*(C`U+201C\*(C'\fR (\s-1LEFT\s0 \s-1DOUBLE\s0 \s-1QUOTATION\s0 \s-1MARK\s0) (to give some examples of
what might look promising) work for newer versions of perl for \f(CW\*(C`sep_char\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR but not for \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If you use perl\-5.8.2 or higher these three attributes are utf8\-decoded, to
increase the likelihood of success. This way \f(CW\*(C`U+00FE\*(C'\fR will be allowed as a
quote character.
.IP "\(bu" 2
A field in  \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR  must be surrounded by double-quotes to make an embedded
double-quote, represented by a pair of consecutive double-quotes, valid. In
binary mode you may additionally use the sequence  \f(CW\*(C`"0\*(C'\fR for representation
of a \s-1NULL\s0 byte. Using \f(CW0x00\fR in binary mode is just as valid.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Several violations of the above specification may be lifted by passing some
options as attributes to the object constructor.

The end-of-line string to add to rows for \*(L"print\*(R" or the record separator

.Sp
When not passed in a \fBparser\fR instance,  the default behavior is to accept
\&\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\er\en\*(C'\fR, so it is probably safer to not specify \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR at
all. Passing \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR or the empty string behave the same.
.Sp
When not passed in a \fBgenerating\fR instance,  records are not terminated at
all, so it is probably wise to pass something you expect. A safe choice for
\&\f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR on output is either \f(CW$/\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\er\en\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Common values for \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR are \f(CW"\e012"\fR (\f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR or Line Feed),  \f(CW"\e015\e012"\fR
(\f(CW\*(C`\er\en\*(C'\fR or Carriage Return, Line Feed),  and \f(CW"\e015"\fR  (\f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR or Carriage
Return). The \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR attribute cannot exceed 7 (\s-1ASCII\s0) characters.
.Sp
If both \f(CW$/\fR and \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR equal \f(CW"\e015"\fR, parsing lines that end on
only a Carriage Return without Line Feed, will be \*(L"parse\*(R"d correct.

If instead you want to escape the  \f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR by doubling
it you will need to also change the  \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR  to be the same as what

This is a quite controversial attribute to set,  but makes some hard things
possible.
.Sp
The rationale behind this attribute is to tell the parser that the normally
special characters newline (\f(CW\*(C`NL\*(C'\fR) and Carriage Return (\f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR)  will not be
special when this flag is set,  and be dealt with  as being ordinary binary
characters. This will ease working with data with embedded newlines.
.Sp
When  \f(CW\*(C`verbatim\*(C'\fR  is used with  \*(L"getline\*(R",  \*(L"getline\*(R"  auto\-\f(CW\*(C`chomp\*(C'\fR's

.Sp
Imagine a file format like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& M^^Hans^Janssen^Klas 2\en2A^Ja^11\-06\-2007#\er\en
.Ve
.Sp
where, the line ending is a very specific \f(CW"#\er\en"\fR, and the sep_char is a
\&\f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR (caret).   None of the fields is quoted,   but embedded binary data is
likely to be present. With the specific line ending, this should not be too
hard to detect.
.Sp
By default,  Text::CSV_XS'  parse function is instructed to only know about
\&\f(CW"\en"\fR and \f(CW"\er"\fR  to be legal line endings,  and so has to deal with the
embedded newline as a real \f(CW\*(C`end\-of\-line\*(C'\fR,  so it can scan the next line if
binary is true, and the newline is inside a quoted field. With this option,
we tell \*(L"parse\*(R" to parse the line as if \f(CW"\en"\fR is just nothing more than
a binary character.
.Sp
For \*(L"parse\*(R" this means that the parser has no more idea about line ending
and \*(L"getline\*(R" \f(CW\*(C`chomp\*(C'\fRs line endings on reading.

.IP "filter" 2
.IX Xref "filter"
.IX Item "filter"
This callback can be used to filter records.  It is called just after a new
record has been scanned.  The callback accepts a hashref where the keys are
the index to the row (the field number, 1\-based) and the values are subs to
return a true or false value.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\& csv (in => "file.csv", filter => {
\&            3 => sub { m/a/ },       # third field should contain an "a"
\&            5 => sub { length > 4 }, # length of the 5th field minimal 5
\&            });
.Ve
.Sp
If the keys to the filter contain any character that in not a digit it will
also implicitly set  \*(L"headers\*(R" to \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR  unless \*(L"headers\*(R" was already
passed as argument.  When headers are active, returning an array of hashes,
the filter is not applicable to the header itself.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& csv (in => "file.csv", filter => { foo => sub { $_ > 4 }});
.Ve
.Sp
All sub results should match, as in \s-1AND\s0.
.Sp
The context of the callback sets  \f(CW$_\fR localized to the field indicated by
the filter. The two arguments are as with all other callbacks, so the other
fields in the current row can be seen:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& filter => { 3 => sub { $_ > 100 ? $_[1][1] =~ m/A/ : $_[1][6] =~ m/B/ }}
.Ve
.Sp
If the context is set to return a list of hashes  (\*(L"headers\*(R" is defined),
the current record will also be available in the localized \f(CW%_\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& filter => { 3 => sub { $_ > 100 && $_{foo} =~ m/A/ && $_{bar} < 1000  }}
.Ve
.Sp
If the filter is used to \fIalter\fR the content by changing \f(CW$_\fR,  make sure
that the sub returns true in order not to have that record skipped:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& filter => { 2 => sub { $_ = uc }}
.Ve
.Sp
will upper-case the second field, and then skip it if the resulting content
evaluates to false. To always accept, end with truth:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& filter => { 2 => sub { $_ = uc; 1 }}
.Ve
.IP "after_in" 2
.IX Xref "after_in"

but before returning the reference to the caller.  The hook is invoked with
two arguments:  the current  \f(CW\*(C`CSV\*(C'\fR  parser object  and a  reference to the
record.   The reference can be a reference to a  \s-1HASH\s0  or a reference to an

I'm already working on perl6 support here <https://github.com/Tux/CSV>. No
promises yet on when it is finished (or fast). Trying to keep the \s-1API\s0 alike
as much as possible.

Requests for adding means (methods) that combine \*(L"combine\*(R" and \*(L"string\*(R"
in a single call will \fBnot\fR be honored (use \*(L"print\*(R" instead).   Likewise
for \*(L"parse\*(R" and \*(L"fields\*(R"  (use \*(L"getline\*(R" instead), given the problems
with embedded newlines.

No guarantees, but this is what I had in mind some time ago:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1DIAGNOSTICS\s0 section in pod to *describe* the errors (see below)
.SH "EBCDIC"
.IX Header "EBCDIC"
The current hard-coding of characters and character ranges  makes this code
unusable on \f(CW\*(C`EBCDIC\*(C'\fR systems. Recent work in perl\-5.20 might change that.
.PP
Opening \f(CW\*(C`EBCDIC\*(C'\fR encoded files on  \f(CW\*(C`ASCII\*(C'\fR+  systems is likely to succeed
using Encode's \f(CW\*(C`cp37\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cp1047\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`posix\-bc\*(C'\fR:
.PP

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
Still under construction ...
.PP
If an error occurs,  \f(CW\*(C`$csv\->error_diag\*(C'\fR can be used to get information
on the cause of the failure. Note that for speed reasons the internal value
is never cleared on success,  so using the value returned by \*(L"error_diag\*(R"
in normal cases \- when no error occurred \- may cause unexpected results.
.PP
If the constructor failed, the cause can be found using \*(L"error_diag\*(R" as a
class method, like \f(CW\*(C`Text::CSV_XS\->error_diag\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`$csv\->error_diag\*(C'\fR method is automatically invoked upon error when
the contractor was called with  \f(CW\*(C`auto_diag\*(C'\fR  set to  \f(CW1\fR or
\&\f(CW2\fR, or when autodie is in effect.  When set to \f(CW1\fR, this will cause a
\&\f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR with the error message,  when set to \f(CW2\fR, it will \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`2012 \-
EOF\*(C'\fR is excluded from \f(CW\*(C`auto_diag\*(C'\fR reports.
.PP
Errors can be (individually) caught using the \*(L"error\*(R" callback.
.PP
The errors as described below are available. I have tried to make the error
itself explanatory enough, but more descriptions will be added. For most of
these errors, the first three capitals describe the error category:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1INI\s0
.Sp
Initialization error or option conflict.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1ECR\s0
.Sp
Carriage-Return related parse error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1EOF\s0
.Sp
End-Of-File related parse error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1EIQ\s0
.Sp
Parse error inside quotation.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1EIF\s0
.Sp
Parse error inside field.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1ECB\s0
.Sp
Combine error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\&\s-1EHR\s0
.Sp
HashRef parse related error.
.PP
And below should be the complete list of error codes that can be returned:
.IP "\(bu" 2
1001 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- sep_char is equal to quote_char or escape_char\*(R"
.IX Xref "1001"
.Sp
The  separation character  cannot be equal to  the quotation
character or to the escape character,  as this
would invalidate all parsing rules.
.IP "\(bu" 2
1002 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- allow_whitespace with escape_char or quote_char \s-1SP\s0 or \s-1TAB\s0\*(R"
.IX Xref "1002"
.Sp
Using the  \f(CW\*(C`allow_whitespace\*(C'\fR  attribute  when either
\&\f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR  is equal to
\&\f(CW\*(C`SPACE\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`TAB\*(C'\fR is too ambiguous to allow.
.IP "\(bu" 2
1003 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- \er or \en in main attr not allowed\*(R"
.IX Xref "1003"
.Sp
Using default \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR characters in either \f(CW\*(C`sep_char\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR,   or  \f(CW\*(C`escape_char\*(C'\fR  is  not
allowed.
.IP "\(bu" 2
1004 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- callbacks should be undef or a hashref\*(R"
.IX Xref "1004"
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`callbacks\*(C'\fR  attribute only allows one to be \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR or
a hash reference.
.IP "\(bu" 2
1005 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- \s-1EOL\s0 too long\*(R"
.IX Xref "1005"
.Sp
The value passed for \s-1EOL\s0 is exceeding its maximum length (16).
.IP "\(bu" 2
1006 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- \s-1SEP\s0 too long\*(R"
.IX Xref "1006"
.Sp
The value passed for \s-1SEP\s0 is exceeding its maximum length (16).
.IP "\(bu" 2
1007 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- \s-1QUOTE\s0 too long\*(R"
.IX Xref "1007"
.Sp
The value passed for \s-1QUOTE\s0 is exceeding its maximum length (16).
.IP "\(bu" 2
2010 \*(L"\s-1ECR\s0 \- \s-1QUO\s0 char inside quotes followed by \s-1CR\s0 not part of \s-1EOL\s0\*(R"
.IX Xref "2010"
.Sp
When  \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR  has  been  set  to  anything  but the  default,  like
\&\f(CW"\er\et\en"\fR,  and  the  \f(CW"\er"\fR  is  following  the   \fBsecond\fR   (closing)
\&\f(CW\*(C`quote_char\*(C'\fR, where the characters following the \f(CW"\er"\fR do
not make up the \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR sequence, this is an error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2011 \*(L"\s-1ECR\s0 \- Characters after end of quoted field\*(R"
.IX Xref "2011"
.Sp
Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`1,foo,"bar"baz,22,1\*(C'\fR are not allowed. \f(CW"bar"\fR is a quoted
field and after the closing double-quote, there should be either a new-line
sequence or a separation character.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2012 \*(L"\s-1EOF\s0 \- End of data in parsing input stream\*(R"
.IX Xref "2012"
.Sp
Self-explaining. End-of-file while inside parsing a stream. Can happen only
when reading from streams with \*(L"getline\*(R",  as using  \*(L"parse\*(R" is done on
strings that are not required to have a trailing \f(CW\*(C`eol\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2013 \*(L"\s-1INI\s0 \- Specification error for fragments \s-1RFC7111\s0\*(R"
.IX Xref "2013"
.Sp
Invalid specification for \s-1URI\s0 \*(L"fragment\*(R" specification.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2021 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- \s-1NL\s0 char inside quotes, binary off\*(R"
.IX Xref "2021"
.Sp
Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`1,"foo\enbar",22,1\*(C'\fR are allowed only when the binary option
has been selected with the constructor.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2022 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- \s-1CR\s0 char inside quotes, binary off\*(R"
.IX Xref "2022"
.Sp
Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`1,"foo\erbar",22,1\*(C'\fR are allowed only when the binary option
has been selected with the constructor.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2023 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- \s-1QUO\s0 character not allowed\*(R"
.IX Xref "2023"
.Sp
Sequences like \f(CW\*(C`"foo "bar" baz",qu\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`2023,",2008\-04\-05,"Foo, Bar",\en\*(C'\fR
will cause this error.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2024 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- \s-1EOF\s0 cannot be escaped, not even inside quotes\*(R"
.IX Xref "2024"
.Sp
The escape character is not allowed as last character in an input stream.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2025 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Loose unescaped escape\*(R"
.IX Xref "2025"
.Sp
An escape character should escape only characters that need escaping.
.Sp
Allowing  the escape  for other characters  is possible  with the attribute
\&\*(L"allow_loose_escape\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 2
2026 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Binary character inside quoted field, binary off\*(R"
.IX Xref "2026"
.Sp
Binary characters are not allowed by default.    Exceptions are fields that
contain valid \s-1UTF\-8\s0,  that will automatically be upgraded if the content is
valid \s-1UTF\-8\s0. Set \f(CW\*(C`binary\*(C'\fR to \f(CW1\fR to accept binary data.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2027 \*(L"\s-1EIQ\s0 \- Quoted field not terminated\*(R"
.IX Xref "2027"
.Sp
When parsing a field that started with a quotation character,  the field is
expected to be closed with a quotation character.   When the parsed line is
exhausted before the quote is found, that field is not terminated.
.IP "\(bu" 2
2030 \*(L"\s-1EIF\s0 \- \s-1NL\s0 char inside unquoted verbatim, binary off\*(R"
.IX Xref "2030"

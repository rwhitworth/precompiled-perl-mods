.SH "STATUS"
.IX Header "STATUS"
Mouse support in Type::Tiny was somewhat of an afterthought. It should
work, but is not anywhere near as well-tested as Moo or Moose
support.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Type::Tiny type constraints have an \s-1API\s0 almost identical to that of
Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint. As a result, you can use a Type::Tiny
object pretty much anywhere you'd use a Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint and
you are unlikely to notice the difference. (And Mouse is unlikely to
notice the difference too!)
.SS "Per-Attribute Coercions"
.IX Subsection "Per-Attribute Coercions"
Type::Tiny offers convenience methods to alter the list of coercions
associated with a type constraint. Let's imagine we wish to allow our
\&\f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR attribute to be coerced from an arrayref of strings.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&      has name => (
\&         is      => "ro",
\&         isa     => Str\->plus_coercions(
\&            ArrayRef[Str], sub { join " ", @{$_} },
\&         ),
\&         coerce  => 1,
\&      );
.Ve
.PP
This coercion will apply to the \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR attribute only; other attributes
using the \f(CW\*(C`Str\*(C'\fR type constraint will be unaffected.
.PP
See the documentation for \f(CW\*(C`plus_coercions\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`minus_coercions\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`no_coercions\*(C'\fR in Type::Tiny.
.SS "Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Optimization"
Mouse's built-in type constraints are implemented using \s-1XS\s0 and are stupidly
fast. For many type constraints, if Type::Tiny notices Mouse is loaded early
enough, Type::Tiny will borrow Mouse's \s-1XS\s0 subs.
.PP
See also Type::Tiny::Manual::Optimization.
.SS "Interactions with MouseX-Types"
.IX Subsection "Interactions with MouseX-Types"
Type::Tiny and MouseX::Types type constraints should \*(L"play nice\*(R". If, for
example, \f(CW\*(C`ArrayRef\*(C'\fR is taken from Types::Standard (i.e. a Type::Tiny\-based
type library), and \f(CW\*(C`PositiveInt\*(C'\fR is taken from MouseX::Types::Common::Numeric,
then the following should \*(L"just work\*(R":
